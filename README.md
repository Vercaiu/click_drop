The purpose of the game is to drop the right description of a mollusk into the correct section. If you get it all correct it will reset with 2 more descriptions.
Each mollusk describes how many descriptions go into their section. Once completely filled it will explain show many are correct for each mollusk.
It is possible that a description can go into multiple different mollusks

there is currently no end game. It will continue endlessly until the limit is reached.
